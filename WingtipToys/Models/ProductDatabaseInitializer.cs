/*
As you can see from the above code, when the database is created and initialized, the Seed
property is overridden and set. When the Seed property is set, the values from the categories
and products are used to populate the database. If you attempt to update the seed data by
modifying the above code after the database has been created, you won't see any updates when
you run the Web application. The reason is the above code uses an implementation of the
DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges class to recognize if the model (schema) has
changed before resetting the seed data. If no changes are made to the Category and
Product entity classes, the database will not be reinitialized with the seed data.
